# DAILY WORK PLANNER

## Description
This is a daily 9am to 5pm work planner which allows the user to add reminders such as events, or meetings. These can be added in for each hour of the work day. It is connected to the Day.js API to update each hour time block as either **Present**, which is red, **Past**, which is grey, and **Future**, which is green. Local storage is utilised to ensure that any reminders added persist on page reload.
